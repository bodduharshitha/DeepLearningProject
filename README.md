# Deep Learning with PyTorch for Digit Classification (MNIST)

This repository contains a simple neural network implemented using PyTorch for digit classification on the MNIST dataset. The neural network is a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer, implemented using the PyTorch neural network module (nn.Module).

## Model Architecture
The neural network architecture is as follows:

Input Layer: 28x28 (784 neurons), 
Hidden Layer: Customizable size and ReLU activation, 
Output Layer: 10 neurons (corresponding to digits 0-9)and softmax activation

## Prerequisites
Python (>=3.6)
PyTorch (>=1.7.0)

## Results
After training, the model achieves a classification accuracy of 95.3% on the MNIST test dataset.

## Acknowledgments
PyTorch developers and the community for providing an excellent deep learning framework.
MNIST dataset creators for providing a valuable resource for digit recognition research.

### Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. Contributions are welcome!
